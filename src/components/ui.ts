 * The look of the app in one place.

 * Two rules hold the palette together. The deck owns four colors — blue
 * clubs, orange diamonds, red hearts, black spades — and the redouble is
 * blue as it is on a bidding box, so the interface itself never spends
 * those: its chrome is grey, its one accent is emerald, and red and amber
 * are kept for what they mean (off system, vulnerable, a hint taken). And
 * every panel is the same surface, so a screen reads as one stack rather
 * than as a pile of differently weighted boxes.
